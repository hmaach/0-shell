## About

We are currently building this shell as part of a system-level programming project. The goal is to recreate core Unix commands using Rust without relying on existing shells like `bash`.

## Features

- Custom prompt (`$`)
- Basic command parsing
- Built-in commands implemented from scratch (like `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, etc.)
